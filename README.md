# ufo-drift
UFO Drift is a simple game clone version of Sling Drift Mobile game. Made with pixi.js.

The Assets used in this game were been taken from https://opengameart.org

# Known issues you may face:
- The game has visible lag with when run on lesser processing power devices such as mobile phones.  
- The Procedural map generation algorithm is not good. It keeps on interferring with the current moving path.
- The collision detection for the spaceship is a single point than a rectangle. (This was made to reduce the amount of computes at first, but this also makes the game easier to play)
